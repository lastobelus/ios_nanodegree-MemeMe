# MemeMe
This is my submission for the MemeMe project in the [Udacity iOS nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003)

It contains several extra features:
* long-press gestures allow re-ordering Memes in the table & grid views
* pinch gesture resizes items in the grid view
* swipe left to delete memes in the table view
* the text labels in the Meme Editor are always constrained to the actual frame of the Meme image, regardless of its aspect ratio
* uses unwind segues so that deleting memes from the detail view is animated in either the table or grid view, whichever the meme was selected from
* images can be cropped & resized & rotated
* it has some minimal onboarding on the first use of the app

I also put a fair amount of effort into organizing and documenting the code. HTML documentation can be generated by [jazzy](https://github.com/Realm/jazzy)) using the `generatedocs.sh` script.

When building and running from source, the command line argument `DeleteAllMemesOnStartup` will delete all memes and re-show onboarding.
